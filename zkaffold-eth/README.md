# üèó zkaffold-eth

Write and compile zero knowledge circuits with [circom](https://docs.circom.io/) and [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) in the `circom` workspace, develop smart contracts utilizing zero knowledge proofs with scaffold-eth.

## Commands

#### `draft`
```
yarn draft <CIRCUIT_NAME>
```

Creates a new file structure for `<CIRCUIT_NAME>` under `packages/circom/circuits/<CIRCUIT_NAME>` with a `circuit.circom` file and and `inputs` folder.

#### `compcir`
```
yarn compcir <CIRCUIT_NAME>
```

Compiles the `circuit.circom` under `packages/circom/circuits/<CIRCUIT_NAME>` and creates all the necessary files for the zero knowledge circuit. A solidity smart contract verifier will also be created in `packages/hardhat/contracts` as `<CIRCUIT_NAME>Verifier.sol`

#### `verify`
```
yarn verify <CIRCUIT_NAME> <INPUT_NAME>.json
```

Verifies whether a proof generated with the set of inputs found in `packages/circom/circuits/<CIRCUIT_NAME>/inputs/<INPUT_NAME>.json` is valid for the `<CIRCUIT_NAME>` zk circuit.
If no `<INPUT_NAME>.json` is provided the command will default to `input.json`.

#### `call`
```
yarn call <CIRCUIT_NAME> <INPUT_NAME>.json
```

Prints the calldata necessary to call the solidity smart contract verifier `<CIRCUIT_NAME>Verifier.sol` with `<INPUT_NAME>.json` into the terminal.
If no `<INPUT_NAME>.json` is provided the command will default to `input.json`.

## `Hash` Circuit Guide

#### Compile `hash` Circuit

- You will find a default zk-circuit `hash` under `packages/circom/circuits/hash/circuit.circom`. Open this file and try to figure out what is going on inside.

- In your terminal use the `yarn compcir hash` command to compile the `hash` zk-circuit.

- If you're on windows you will need to navigate to `packages/circom/node_modules/snarkjs/build/cli.cjs` and replace the contents of this file with a modified version found [here](https://github.com/calvbore/snarkjs/blob/master/build/cli.cjs) before you run the `compcir` command.

- You should now see the message `[INFO]  snarkJS: OK!` in your terminal after the compilation has completed.

- The contract found in `packages/hardhat/contracts/hashVerifier.sol` should now be updated as well.

#### Verify `hash` Proofs with Various Inputs

- Now navigate to `packages/circom/circuits/hash/inputs/`, you will find the two files `input.json` and `invalid.json`. These files provide the input variables for your zk-circuit. Take a look at them.

- Now run `yarn verify hash`. The `verify` command will default to use a file named `input.json`. You will receive this message: `hash: Verification OK`, along with the proof for the inputs.

- Next run `yarn verify hash input.json`, you will receive the same output as the previous command, now try `yarn verify hash invalid.json`. You will receive this message: `hash: Invalid proof`, along with the proof for the inputs.

#### Verify Proofs with a Solidity Contract

- Open two new terminals in the project root. in the first run `yarn chain`, in the second run `yarn start`. Now go back to your original terminal and run `yarn deploy`.

- After your front end has loaded grab funds from the faucet, find the `setPurpose` function and set the purpose to `Testing ZK Proofs!!`.

- Now, if the purpose has changed without any issues, in your original terminal run `yarn call hash`.

You will receive the data you will need to call the solidity zk-proof verifier. This is the data generated by default for `input.json`:
```

You will see two functions in the front end that take four arrays as inputs each: `verifyProof` and `testVerifyProof`.

`verifyProof` will take your generated proof calldata and return a bool indicating whether or not the proof is valid. Let's test it!

- This time we'll do `yarn call hash input.json` to get used to calling specific inputs. You will need to copy each array individually:

>uint256[2] a

```

```
`verifyProof` will return a `true` boolean with these inputs (as long as the compilation steps were followed as above, as the circuit was generated deterministically).

Now let's get a `false` return value!

- `yarn call hash invalid.json`

>uint256[2] a

```

```
These inputs will return a `false` boolean as they are an intentionally invalid proof.

Okay, let's put these same inputs in the `testVerifyProof` function.

```
Transaction Error
VM Exception while processing transaction: revert Invalid Proof
```

This is good! Let's navigate to `packages/hardhat/contracts/YourContract.sol` to see what happened.

On line 32 we see this require statement:
```
require(verifyProof(a, b, c, input), "Invalid Proof");
```
This line calls the `verifyProof` function we were playing with before and requires it to return a `true` boolean for the transaction to be accepted.

Now let's use the solidity calldata for our valid proof:

>uint256[2] a

```
["0x21079367847c16de713f5051c84061999ac64e177086f14998144faf764f6303", "0x137f81c06d8947e111b3655dae2ba4070ded029b65f2975cba79d6b706d7b0b1"]

```
>uint256[2] c

```

```
YES!! It went though this time. And we modified a state variable of our solidity contract in the process. The contract's `verifiedHash` variable now has a value.

We just proved that we know the input value that hashes to `verifiedHash` without revealing what that value actually is!

(Although, we did not do this securely, like at all)

#### Create your own circuit

Give the `draft` command a try!
```
yarn draft <YOUR_CIRCUIT_NAME>
```
This will create a blank circuit template for you to try out!
